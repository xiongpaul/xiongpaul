- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @xiongpaul. A computer programming graduate who is still looking for an opportunity to work in the tech industry as a software developer or tech support professional.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things. I am a very passionate car enthusiast, I also spend some time playing video games and watching anime. Lately I've been looking for a nostalgia fix, so I've been watching movies from the late 20th century. I am also interested in foreign languages.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning (or re-learning) web development and also trying to further improve my Japanese language skills and of course, finally learn (or re-learn) the German language(because I took it in high school once).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... of course, the easiest way is through email at paul.nost.xiong@gmail.com
